## Built using Foam
If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.


To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.
### Note on `[[wiki-links]]`

‚ö†Ô∏è Until [foambubble/foam#16](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/16) is resolved, `[[wiki-links]]` links (like the links above) won't work in the GitHub Markdown preview (i.e. this Readme on github.com).

They should work as expected in VS Code, and in rendered GitHub Pages.

If GitHub preview (or general 100% support with all Markdown tools) is a requirement, for the time being you can use the standard `[description](page.md)` syntax.
