## Features of an accessible web page

### Semantic structure

It can indicate their position in the heirarchy of the document and the ways they can interact with the different elements of the page, as well as providing emphasis to textual content in the right places

```html
<ul>
  <li>Menu Item 1</li>
  <li>Menu Item 2</li>
  <li>Menu Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
