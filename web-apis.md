# Web APIs

## Broadcast Channel API

The Broadcast Channel API allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the same origin. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.

## Domains

### Testing
There are official domains youâ€™re supposed to use for documentation, testing, etc. They are specifically reserved by IANA for these purposes. Originally it was just example.com, but they now have a list of all them: [https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved](https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved)
