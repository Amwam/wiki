# Web APIs

## Broadcast Channel API

The Broadcast Channel API allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the same origin. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.
